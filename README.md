# BLOG-WEBSITE.
 Building a Platform for Sharing Your Thoughts 📝
🔍 Introduction: 
In this project, I developed a blog website using HTML, CSS, Node.js, and MongoDB for data storage. The website allows users to read and write posts on various topics. 📊
📌 Steps I Took:
Designing the Website:
    => Created a simple and intuitive user interface using HTML and CSS.
     Added form validation to ensure that users enter valid data.
Connecting to MongoDB:
    => Set up a MongoDB database to store user information and blog posts.
     Used Node.js to connect to the database.
Handling User Authentication:
    => Created a user authentication system using Passport.js.
     Implemented password hashing and salting for security.
